<h1>Sergio Isla</h1>
<h2>Data Scientist</h2>
<p>I just finished my Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon and am eager to continue developing mainly this new path.</p>

<p>I'm an engineer with technical and administrative experience in search of improving the efficiency of the business activities. I achieve my responsibilities through effective prioritization before work in challenging environments, conciliatory attitude, and opportune communication.

During the last two weeks of the bootcamp, three mates and I developed an app showing the crimes in Mexico City, plus a map showing a forecast of the crimes in Mexico City during the next 6 months:</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>Later I developed a map showing the most frequent Ecobici trips from a specific bike station to a specific bike station during March, 2023.</p>


<div w3-include-html="ecobici_flow_map.html"></div>
<script>
function includeHTML() {
  var z, i, elmnt, file, xhttp;
  /* Loop through a collection of all HTML elements: */
  z = document.getElementsByTagName("*");
  for (i = 0; i < z.length; i++) {
    elmnt = z[i];
    /*search for elements with a certain atrribute:*/
    file = elmnt.getAttribute("w3-include-html");
    if (file) {
      /* Make an HTTP request using the attribute value as the file name: */
      xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState == 4) {
          if (this.status == 200) {elmnt.innerHTML = this.responseText;}
          if (this.status == 404) {elmnt.innerHTML = "Page not found.";}
          /* Remove the attribute, and call this function once more: */
          elmnt.removeAttribute("w3-include-html");
          includeHTML();
        }
      }
      xhttp.open("GET", file, true);
      xhttp.send();
      /* Exit the function: */
      return;
    }
  }
}
