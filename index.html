<h1>Sergio Isla</h1>
<h2>Data Scientist</h2>
<p>I just finished my Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon and am eager to continue developing mainly this new path.</p>

<p>I'm an engineer with technical and administrative experience in search of improving the efficiency of the business activities. I achieve my responsibilities through effective prioritization before work in challenging environments, conciliatory attitude, and opportune communication.</p>

<p>During the last two weeks of the bootcamp, three mates and I developed an app showing the crimes in Mexico City, plus a map showing a forecast of the crimes in Mexico City during the next 6 months:</p>

<p>Later I developed a map showing the most frequent Ecobici trips from a specific bike station to a specific bike station during March, 2023.</p>
